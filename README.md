Things to consider:
* Try to make snippet syntactically complete but minimalist outline of functionality.
* Be mindful of the tab completion order, think about how a user might construct this snippet.
* Resuse common variable names or elements inside the snippet to reduce typing
* Snippet should both save time and provide user with useful example syntax.
* Try to adhere to latest idomatic standards for Ember App Kit and the Ember JS API.
* Use logical prefix in tab trigger (eak, hbs, coffee) so that common snippets are grouped together.

Below is an example of a complete snippet. This one create a utility function for EAK.

```
<snippet>
    <content><![CDATA[
/*
* @method ${1:utilityName}
* @param {${5:String}} ${2:input} ${4:TODO: Needs documentation...}
*/

function ${1:utilityName}(${2:input}) {
  // Do something with ${2:input} 
  var ${3:transform} = ${2:input} + "foo";
  return ${3:transform};
}

export default ${1:utilityName};


]]></content>
